```

## Security Features

- **Protected Routes**: Admin dashboard is only accessible to authenticated users
- **Role-Based Access**: Currently supports admin role
- **Session Persistence**: Login state persists across browser sessions
- **Automatic Redirects**: Unauthorized users are redirected to home page

## Customization

### Adding New Roles
1. Update the `AuthContext.tsx` to handle new roles
2. Modify `ProtectedRoute.tsx` to check for new roles
3. Update the login logic to assign appropriate roles

### Adding New Admin Features
1. Create new components in the admin dashboard
2. Add new tabs or sections as needed
3. Integrate with the existing authentication system

### Styling
- The system uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Components follow the existing design system
- Animations use Framer Motion for smooth transitions

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real API integration for authentication
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] User registration system
- [ ] Advanced role management
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Session timeout management
- [ ] Real-time notifications

## Technical Notes

- Built with React 18 and TypeScript
- Uses React Router for navigation
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Local storage for session persistence
- Context API for state management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login not working**: Ensure you're using the correct demo credentials
2. **Dashboard not loading**: Check if you're properly authenticated
3. **Route protection issues**: Verify the ProtectedRoute component is properly configured

### Development

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that all imports are correct
- Ensure the authentication context is properly wrapped around your app

## Support

For any issues or questions about the login system, check the component files for implementation details or refer to the authentication context for state management logic.
